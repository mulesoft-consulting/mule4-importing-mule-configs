# mule4-importing-mule-configs
This is a Mule 4.1 project that imports a Mule configuration file from an external dependency (jar file). This is used in conjunction with the mule4-importable-mule-configs project to demonstrate how to import Mule config files.

Depending upon which file is imported (there are two to choose from), the behavior of the flow will be slightly different.

See the config.xml Mule config file to see the import statement.

The two choices are:

* option-two-flows.xml
* option-one-flows.xml
